# Word Guess Game

* **Objective**
    * To create a program which prompts a user to guess a word
* **Purpose**
    * To gain familiarity with strings, arrays, and console input and output


## Instructions

### As you start

Right away:
Add your name as a comment to the Wordguess.java class, and do the "git trio" in a terminal ->

```
git add .
git commit -m "added my name"
git push origin main
```

Check the web page for your repo, make sure your change has appeared there.

### Now Then

This is a simple game creation project. You are encouraged to make your game class and then to add cool things to it.

The game looks something like this when the player loses.

```
Let's Play Wordguess version 1.0
Current Guesses: 
_ _ _ _ 
You have 4 tries left.
Enter a single character: 
f
Current Guesses: 
_ _ _ _ 
You have 3 tries left.
Enter a single character: 
c
Current Guesses: 
_ _ _ _ 
You have 2 tries left.
Enter a single character: 
e
Current Guesses: 
_ _ _ e 
You have 1 tries left.
Enter a single character: 
f
:-( :-( :-(
_ _ _ e 
You Lost! You ran out of guesses.
Would you like to play again? (yes/no) 
no
Game Over.
```

And like this if the player wins.

```

Congratulations, You Won!
Would you like to play again? (yes/no) 
no
Game Over.
```

The idea is, the player...

- starts the game
- a random word is chosen from a list
- the number of tries allowed is set to the length of the word
- setup the two (the solution and the player's guesses) character arrays
- WHILE the numbers of tries is less than tries allowed AND
- the player has not guessed the word
    - print the current state of the player's guesses
    - ask the player for a letter (a character)
    - if the letter is a minus "-", quit the game
    - else process the letter
    - if the letter makes the work complete,
        - the player wins
- after the while loop
    - if the word is not guessed, player loses

Now, another twist to the game is to add an "outer loop" which asks the player if they would like to play again. This outer loop would surround the logic in the outline above.

But for v1, just create the game to play a single word each time it is run.
Once you have that running, add the outer loop.
Call it v2.

Write the main Wordguess class, and the needed game methods.
Try to keep your methods small.
If the methods get too big, break them up into smaller pieces with other methods.
Read [Notes.md](./Notes.md) to understand more about how you might design the internals of the Wordguess class.

BE SURE to do git commits along the way.
You don't want to lose any code.




## How to Download

### Part 1 - Forking the Project
* To _fork_ the project, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of the project.


### Part 2 - Navigating to _forked_ Repository
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Copy the URL of the project to the clipboard.

### Part 3 - Cloning _forked_ repository
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
    * if you do not have a `~/dev` directory, make one by executing the following command:
        * `mkdir ~/dev`
    * navigate to the `~/dev` directory by executing the following command:
        * `cd ~/dev`
    * clone the project by executing the following command:
        * `git clone https://github.com/MYUSERNAME/NAMEOFPROJECT`

### Part 4 - Check Build
* Ensure that the tests run upon opening the project.
    * You should see `Tests Failed: ${number-of-tests} of ${number-of-tests} tests`
* Execute the command below to run `JUnit` tests from the command line.
    * `mvn package -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true`







## How to Submit

### Part 1 -  _Pushing_ local changes to remote repository
* from a _terminal_ navigate to the root directory of the _cloned_ project.
* from the root directory of the project, execute the following commands:
    * add all changes
        * `git add .`
    * commit changes to be pushed
        * `git commit -m 'I have added changes'`
    * push changes to your repository
        * `git push -u origin main`

### Part 2 - Submitting assignment
* Turn It in - the repo url you just `push`'d
